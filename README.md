## About Me

I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

I build an app to teach everyone more about me. It will have a short biography, education history, overview of my job experiences, and goals of mines. I will have a short quiz about me that will start in 10 seconds.
